# Teamwork_iter3

## How often you met, and why you met that often?
Approximately 1-2 times a week.
Details are listed below.
### 08/11/19 from 1pm to 4pm
We first Issued the current problems
1. Backend tests coverage is not yet 100%, some of the tests cannot be passed
2. Codes do not all satisfy the KISS and DRY principles. More helper functions as well as decorators are needed.
3. Construction of function upload_photo is in progress, however encounter plenty of issues which may require help.
4. Some files are low in pylint assessment. Format + comments are needed to add. 
5. Paperwork needs to be done. 
6. Some of the functions are not working well with front end. 
 
Then we spent the rest of the time fixing. We finally achieved:
1. Some decorators were added. 
2. Tests coverage was increased.
3. Certain functions were fixed, more tests passed.
4. The first version of upload_photos function was out, however did not work with the front end.

### 09/11/19 from 12pm to 5pm
We continued on fixing the problem we have addressed in the first meeting.
In this five-hour session, we have fixed:
1. More decorators were added.
2. Broken functions were fixed, more tests passed.
3. Second version of upload_photo function was out, but still had issues with the front end. 

### 15/11/19 from 1pm to 5pm
We continued on fixing the problem we have addressed in the first meeting.
In this four-hour session, we have fixed:
1. Almost all of the functions were fixed and done.
2. All of the tests were able to pass. 
3. Coverage was increased to 99% in total.
4. Upload_photo function was fixed, finally worked with the front end.
5. Pylint are done for half of the files.

The rest of the issues were done on Saturday. 


## What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful?
1. We issued the current problems at the beginning of every team meeting to promote production. 
2. We occupied a round table in the library, therefore members were able to supervise each other from any sort of distraction.
3. We relaxed 10 minutes per hour.



## What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration 3

During iteration 3, there were several times that things did not go along with plan. The construction of upload_photo function encountered unaccountable barriers,  and did not follow up with the plan. The step we took to resolve this issue was to first gather ideas from the group. We went online and did some research, however we were only able to fix a small part of it. Therefore the next step we took was to seek advice from tutors and help session, then put up all of the solutions together which finally allow the problems to be fixed. 

Another problem we encountered was adding decorators. At first decorators were not designed collectively, therefore most of them could only be used  for a limited number of functions instead of all. Hence some of the decorators had to be redesigned in terms of the arguments they took in. The time we used to add decorators took longer than we thought and resulted in us failed to keep up with the plan, so the first step we took was to list all of the decorators that will need to be redesigned. The next step was to ask group members to put down the functions that will need those decorators especially the argument type. The last step was to reconstruct and implement. 

In order to catch up with the progress, we ensured to constantly update the plan and maintain regular communication. The step we took to resolve issues involved agile practices and team collaboration, which both significantly contributed to a successful outcome. 




## Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code

Working on the same code involved regular catch-up and efficient communication. In order to make it achievable, we chose to hold face-to-face meetings 1~2 times per week. During the meeting we did not only address the issues but put more focus on the actual construction and implementation, especially when working on the same code. In order to minimise conflict, we decided to let one person work on the laptop, whereas the others surrounded and discussed the next move. A face-to-face discussion minimised misunderstandings and ensured all thoughts can be tested and put into pratice straight away, which does not highly increased efficiency, but also promote team production.

When we were at home and worked individually, we maintained a regular communication through telegram app. We posted our current progress as well as informed changes at least once a day. Whoever pushed new update to the master branch would make an announcement in the group chat to ensure people that have been working on the same code received the newest update. Additionally, important changes as well as upcoming tasks were pinned as marked messages for future reference.
