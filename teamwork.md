## Teamwork analysis

*Team meeting 1:*
Date: 11/10/19
Goal: Distribute tasks, have a brief discussion on how functions are related to each other. 
*Team meeting 2:*
Date: 18/10/19
Goal: Set up a data construction 
*Team meeting 3:*
Date: 26/10/19
Goal: All members reached the state of finally testing with frontend or Postman


How often you met, and why you met that often:
- We met at least one time a week and kept on communicating with each other on a daily basis. A regular catch up ensures the work done interactively and collaboratively. Since the functions we constructed were heavily dependent on each other, a suitable data structure needs to be built. Variables that stored in iter3.py should have a specific format for efficient access and modification. Hence a regular meet up is necessary in terms of collecting thoughts on building an appropriate data structure based on everyone's needs, as well as informing changes and sharing progress. 

What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful
-	During the first meeting, we borrowed the method from this project, made a five-minute ?stand up? session to let everyone write down their needs for the functions they were going to work on. This method allowed us to have a general outlook on data construction. 
-	When writing functions, we not only commented for code explanation but also wrote down the ambiguity of the spec that needed a unified assumption. They were expected to be thoroughly discussed during team meeting and reached a consensus at the end. 

What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration two
-	
-	When running into problems, we decomposed the task into even smaller minestone, treat unresolved and delayed issues as must-done tasks in a self-set sprint. This promotes members to try their best to solve problems in a short period of time. It is highly encouraged for a member to ask in group chat or go to help session as to resolve issues in the quickest way.
-	Another way was to replan the progress of the project. Both ways need time management, which was the most challenging aspect of the project.


Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code
-	We add, commit, and push changes on our own branch regularly, and asked other group members to assess the code. Members are allowed to make changes as well as leave comments or suggestions under functions. Functions with errors due to the change in iter3.py will be labelled as FIX ME, as to inform the producer recheck the data-contained file.
