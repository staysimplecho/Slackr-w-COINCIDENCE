## Meetings:
1. Date: 25/9/19  
   Duration: 1hour  
   Outcome: We officially launched the project and assigned the work for user stories to each member.   
2. Date: 01/10/19  
   Duration: 2hours  
   Outcome: Modified and implemented everyone's user stories.  
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Discussed the strategy of working on function tests and distributed tasks for both pytest and paperwork.    
3. Date: 03/10/19  
   Duration: 1hour  
   Outcome: We analysed some of the function tests in detail and had an intense discussion on how to construct them properly.   
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194; Clarified some confusing ideas, allowed us to have a further understanding of making function tests.     
4. Date: 05/10/19  
   Duration: 10am~5pm  
   Outcome: Summarized, communicated and shared individual's work.   
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Checked for the consistency of assumptions.   
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Improved function tests in terms of adding more edge cases(based on the new universal assumptions).  
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Put user stories to the task board. Reflected on iteration 1 and planned for iteration 2.  


## Task allocation:  
Christina:  user stories, pytests (channel part and additional features), plan, assumptions  
Echo: user stories, combine all user stories, pytests (message part), assumptions  
Edward: user stories, pytests (auth set up part), reflection, assumptions  
Leila: user stories, pytests (profile part), reflection, assumptions  

        	    	
## Reflection on Areas for improvement:  
a. Task allocation was done roughly by breaking down dot points/functions into 4 parts by the given order as to distribute the work evenly, but the internal connection among certain dot points was ignored. Therefore content-related dot points were assigned to different members, resulted in members doing similar work repeatedly and did not hold the consistency of assumptions. This can be improved by assigning dot points/functions according to content instead of order.   
b. Piazza was not fully used or regularly checked, therefore we did not receive the newest update when constructing tests. Hence piazza should be checked at least once a day in the next iteration.    
c. We did not check the progress with each other regularly when working on function tests, which resulted in members making different assumptions. This issue took a significant period of time to be fixed on our final meeting.   
d. When changing functions at personal branches, some of the members did not add - commit - push everytime after changing, resulted in conflicts afterwards. Therefore in the next iteration, we should constantly be reminded of this pushing process, in order to minimize the chances of having conflicts.  

## Impression that team has worked together collaboratively:
a. We launched the project straight after the specification was released, and distributed the work efficiently. This allowed us to have enough time to work on not only the assigned job but also the unspecified details. It also allowed members who were able to finish their work before the group due date(e.g user stories done by 01/10/19) to help other members who had issues.  
b. We created several google docs which allowed us to edit schronisely. This highly increased the efficiency and showed the positive aspect of working collaboratively.   

 

## Impression that team had processes in place to work through disagreements or tension:
a. When disagreements raised, members first tried to communicate with not only the opponents but the whole group by explaining/clarifying their logic with patience.   
b. When disagreements raised and could not be solved inside the group, we invited a third party(e.g tutor/lab assistant) to step in and make suggestions from their point of view. This allowed us to solve the problem from another approach as a fresh/professional suggestion was given.   


## Impression that team had a thought-out methodology for completing this iteration:
a. As a team, the first step we took was to separate the work into several achievable parts, and worked in pairs of two.  A pair of two allowed an easier integration of the work so that we can keep track on each other and provide feedback on time.  
b. After assigning the work, we set up a group due time to promote productivity and prevent incrementing workload.   
User stories due date: 1/10/19  
Pytest + assumption first version due date: 04/10/19  
Plan + reflection + pytest+assumption final version: 05/10/19  
c. The progress will be checked on the final meeting on 05/10/19. During the 10am-5pm group meeting, we planned to:  
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Firstly, check each other's assumption for each function as to hold the consistency of unspecified details.   
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Then, we go through each other's pytest, ensure the completion of tests in terms of:   programs' internal logic, sufficient edge cases, assumptions' consistancy.   
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Thirdly, we reflect on our performance in iteration 1 and finish reflection.md.    
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Then, we will read through the functions again and plan on the implementation stage for iteration 2 and finish plan.md.   
&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;Lastly, we merge our branches to master and finish iteration 1.  
By the end of the meeting, we successfully finished off the work.
In conclusion,by having a thought-out methodology, we ensured that every step we took contributed to the completion of iteration 1 correctly and efficiently.
